## Yujia Li

I am an algorithm engineer in the remote sensing industry. My interest lies in optimizing the processing speed of huge remote sensing data and applying deep learning algorithm. 

- 🌱 Here are few published papers from my early years in school:

[Urban Land Expansion Simulation Considering the Diffusional and Aggregated Growth Simultaneously: A Case Study of Luoyang City](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/17/9781 )

[ Utilizing User-Generated Content and GIS for Flood Susceptibility Modeling in Mountainous Areas: A Case Study of Jian City in China](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13126929)
